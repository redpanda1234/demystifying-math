# Who I am:
Hello!  My name is Forest.  I am a rising sophomore at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu), a small ~~liberal arts college~~ tech school in southern california.  I was born and raised in Juneau, Alaska (a small, remote city that is only reachable by plane or boat, is *technically* larger than the state of Rhode Island, and has a total population of ~30,000), before moving to Honolulu, Hawaii in 9th grade.  There, I attended [Punahou School](https://www.punahou.edu/), and graduated as a member of the class of 2016.  Currently, my interests include (but are not limited to) hiking, blindly stumbling my way through horrific computer science projects, violin, skiing, pretending I read books, and photography.  There are unconfirmed reports that I am wholly incompetent in many of these pursuits, but at least I try.  As of now, I am a declared joint math-physics major, and am currently in the process of building this site to host a series of in-depth explanations for topics in math and physics.  

Math and physics are strange subjects.  When explained properly, they are *relentlessly* beautiful subjects full of nuance and complexity, and can completely reshape one's worldview.  But, when explained poorly, they are some of the most remarkably painful, tedious, and uninspiring subjects that I have *ever* encountered.  

I think that one of the largest obstacles to math and physics education is the general stigma that surrounds them.  In particular, people tend to think that math and physics are only for "geniuses," or that some people just "have the right mind" for it and are thus better than others.  I think that both of these viewpoints are emblematic of a deeper issue: **the manner in which math and physics are typically communicated.**  Ultimately, learning math and physics is a lot like studying a foreign language: 






# The project:
In writing this I'm trying to demystify a lot of the unnecessary opacity of mathematics, especially for people who haven't had a math course in many years, or always found math inscrutable in some sense.  If you have any feedback, please don't hesistate to send me a facebook message, or email me at <contact.demystifyingmath@gmail.com>.  In particular, I am interested in hearing about:

* Making sure my writing contains no [mathematical microaggressions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g9igfzl5u55lvyj/Su_Mathematical%20Microaggressions.pdf?dl=0)
* Anywhere the phrasing is dense and confusing
* How I could better improve the transition from my sketches and verbal definitions to mathematical language
* how helpful / annoying / aggressive the current examples are, and if there are any you think would be good to add
* Anywhere I could better motivate the necessity for a better notation system / for a concept I introduce later
* Any math mistakes / misc. typos
* Any other feedback on the general structure

# How this site was built:
This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.  Currently, it is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a hosting service that's free for open-source projects (they're pretty cool---go check them out).  

The documents themselves are written in [LaTeX](https://latex-project.org/), a free piece of softwar
