# The Project

## Description

This website is a personal project of mine that aims to make topics in
introductory math and physics courses less opaque.

For a while now, I have been frustrated with the way math and physics
are are typically taught in american high schools and colleges.
Oftentimes, courses emphasize rote memorization and computation
instead of honing intuition, and generally eschew teaching
students "how to think" about a given subject.

For students at the very very top of their classes, this usually isn't
much of an issue.  They can often fill in the intuition themselves,
and better spend their time poring over the countless _fantastic_
resources available to them whenever they get bored of class ---
e.g., [Evan Chen's Napkin project](http://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.htmlhttp://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html). Most educators are aware of
this --- which, for exceptional students, is great.  It is
liberating to be let loose to learn and discover on your own,
especially if it means being freed from a boring class in which you've
finally worked up the [guts](https://usamo.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/writing/) to admit that you might know more than
your teacher does.

For the rest of the students, though, it really kinda sucks.
Oftentimes, instructors  assume that if you really _are_ a burgeoning
mathematician/physicist/etc., you should be able to handle all the
learning yourself --- so, they focus instead on drilling the
"unexceptional" portion of the class with equally "unexceptional"
practice problems, examples, and befuddling analogies, hoping to just
get them all through the course and out the door.

This is lazy teaching.  And, as is often the case, it turns out that
**things aren't actually as black-and-white** as _"some students are
exceptional, most aren't."_  Educators often forget that what people
refer to as "genius" is more of a description of the end sum of many
factors hidden to the naked eye --- chief among which are practice,
experience, and a healthy dose of luck (Terence Tao
wrote [a wonderful piece](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/) on this that you should all read, when
you have the time).

Importantly, these are all things that (to some extent or another)
_can be taught by a teacher, and learned by a student._ Frequently,
when a student is struggling in a math or physics course, it because
of a misunderstanding of the prerequisite knowledge, or a dearth of
experience. Because a teacher (ideally) possesses both knowledge and
experience, it is their job to identify what the student lacks, and
help them to build their understanding to the point where they can
learn independently.  In that sense, I think an educator's role should
be to try (as much as possible) to give every student the tools they
need to move into the "exceptional" camp.

The documents I have posted here are my first attempts at creating
resources to facilitate this transition.  My goal was to make texts
that were similar to Evan Chen's Napkin project, but tailored to the
students who don't yet have the experience and/or knowledge to fill in
the gaps themselves.  As much as possible, I try to place emphasis on
intuition and motivating examples, instead of messy calculations and
unexplained theorems.  If you have any feedback (on the texts
themselves, the website's design, or even the general quality of my
writing), please don't hesitate to open an issue report [here](https://github.com/redpanda1234/demystifying-math/issues), or
send me an [email](contact.simplemath@gmail.com).
